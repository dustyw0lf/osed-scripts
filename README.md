# osed-scripts
Scripts I used during the EXP-301/OSED course, based on scripts by Ben 'epi' Risher at [osed-scripts](https://github.com/epi052/osed-scripts).

`setup.ps1`: Windows VM setup script.

`attach-process.ps1`: Start an app with WinDbg attached, and restart it on exit.

`find-bad-chars.py`: Generate a bytes string of bad characters and compare a bytes string with a memory address.
Compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
