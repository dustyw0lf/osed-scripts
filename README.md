# osed-scripts
Scripts I used during the EXP-301/OSED course, based on scripts by Ben 'epi' Risher at [osed-scripts](https://github.com/epi052/osed-scripts).

`setup.ps1`: Windows VM setup script.

`attach-process.ps1`: Start an app with WinDbg attached, and restart it on exit.

`find-bad-chars.py`: Generates a bytes string of bad chars and compares bytes string to with a memory address.
                     Compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
